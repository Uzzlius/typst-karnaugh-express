# Karnaugh

`karnaugh-express` is a [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) package for creating highly customizable Karnaugh maps.

## Overview

The `karnaugh` function takes two required arguments: `variables` and `values`. You can pass a `terms` argument to automatically draw minterms or maxterms.

```typ
#import "@preview/karnaugh-express:1.0.0": karnaugh

#karnaugh(
  ("d", "c", "b", "a"),
  (1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1),
  terms: ("!b & !a", "a | b"),
)
```

## Placement of Values

Values are automatically placed so that you can read them directly from a truth table. Take the following table:

| a | b | c | position |
| - | - | - | -------- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0        |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1        |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 2        |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 3        |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 4        |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 5        |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 6        |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 7        |

```typ
#import "@preview/karnaugh-express:0.1.1": karnaugh

#karnaugh(
  ("a", "b", "c"),
  (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7),
)
```
<img src="examples/example-2.png" width="250" alt = "A 2x4 Karnaugh map for variables a, b, and c. Each cell contains its corresponding decimal index (0 through 7) to demonstrate how values from a truth table are mapped to the grid.">

## Arranging Variables on the Axis

### 1. Standard Arrangement
There are different ways of arranging variables on a Karnaugh map. One is the standard layout shown in the previous images. `karnaugh-express` supports two standard layouts that can be selected with the `arrangement-standard` argument. 

`arrangement-standard: 0` is used in the first image. It is the most common way of arranging variables on K-maps and thus the standard setting of this package. `arrangement-standard: 1` is a different option that is often used and looks like this.

```typ
#import "@preview/karnaugh-express:0.1.1": karnaugh

#karnaugh(
  ("a", "b", "c", "d"),
  (1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1),
  arrangement-standard: 1,
  terms: ("!b & !a", "a & b")
)
```
<img src="examples/example-3.png" width="250" alt = "A 4x4 Karnaugh map for variables a, b, c, and d using arrangement-standard: 1.">
    
### 2. Custom Arrangement
You can also specify a completely custom arrangement. Just provide an `arrangement` parameter as an array of two arrays. The first array contains the row axis variables, and the second array contains the column axis variables:

```typ
#import "@preview/karnaugh-express:0.1.1": karnaugh

#karnaugh(
  ("a", "b", "c", "d"),
  (1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1),
  arrangement: (("a",), ("b", "d", "c")),
  terms: ("!b & !a", "a & b")
)
```
<img src="examples/example-4.png" width="250" alt = "A 2x8 Karnaugh map demonstrating a custom arrangement where variable a is on the vertical bar and b, d, c are on the horizontal bars.">

## Terms 

To select cells in the K-map, you need to pass the `terms` parameter, which is an array of strings. Each element of the array represents a separate term. Both minterms and maxterms are supported. For minterms, a term would look like `"a & !b"` and for maxterms, it would look like `"a | !b"`.

In case you ever want to select cells that do not form a minterm or maxterm, you can pass the `custom-highlightings` argument. This is an array of arrays of numbers. The numbers represent the indices of the cells. For example `((1, 3, 7),)`.

All together, this could look something like this.

```typ
#karnaugh(
  ("a", "b", "c", "d"), (),
  terms: ("!b & a", "c | d"),
  custom-highlightings: ((3, 10, 4), (11)),
)
```
<img src="examples/example-5.png" width="250" alt = "A 4x4 Karnaugh map where cells 3, 10 and 4 are highlighted in yellow and cell 11 is highlighted in purple.">

### Gaps
Use highlight-inset to control the gap between the grid and a highlight outline.

When multiple highlights overlap, readability can be improved by varying the inset for each term. The amount by which successive highlights are offset is determined by highlight-stroke. Use highlight-steps to specify how many different inset levels should be used before the pattern repeats.

```typ
#import "@preview/karnaugh-express:0.1.1": karnaugh

#karnaugh(
  ("a", "b", "c", "d"), (),
  terms: ("b & d", "b & d", "b & d", "b & d"),
  highlight-inset: 0.1,
  highlight-steps: 4,
  highlight-stroke: (thickness: 2pt, dash: "dashed")
)
```
<img src="examples/example-6.png" width="250" alt = "A 4×4 Karnaugh map with four highlighted terms using different outline inset levels to keep overlapping highlights visually distinct. The outlines are now dashed and 2pt thick.">

## Display Variables

Because the variables you pass into the `karnaugh` function fulfill a functional purpose (used to specify which cells should be highlighted), they cannot be passed in math mode. This is what the `var-disp` parameter is for. Just create a second array detailing how you want each variable to be displayed, in the exact same order as your functional variables:

```typ
#import "@preview/karnaugh-express:0.1.1": karnaugh

#karnaugh(
  ("a", "b", "c", "d"),
  (),
  var-disp: ($x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$),
  arrangement-standard: 1
)
```
<img src="examples/example-7.png" width="250" alt = "The grid is arranged in the same way as the first example. However, the bars are no longer labeled a, b, c, d but instead x_1, x_2, x_3 and x_4 in math-mode.">

## Cetz canvas integration
`karnaugh-express` is based on cetz. You can thus use `draw-karnaugh` inside of a cetz canvas to integrate other drawables in a K-map. It is possible to name a K-map using the `name` argument. You can then use `name.x` where `x` is the index of a cell, to reference the center of the corresponding cell inside of cetz.

```typ
#import "@preview/cetz:0.5.3": canvas, draw
#import "@preview/karnaugh-express:1.0.0": karnaugh, draw-karnaugh

#canvas({
  import draw: *

  draw-karnaugh(
    ("a", "b", "c", "d"), (),
    name: "k1"
  )

  line((0, 0), "k1.7")
  circle("k1.7", radius: 1, stroke: red)
})
```

<img src="examples/example-8.png" width="250" alt = "A line going from cell 8 to cell 7 and a red circle circling cell 7 is drawn on top of the K-map.">

`draw-karnaugh` and `karnaugh` behave exactly the same, as `karnaugh` is just a wrapper for `draw-karnaugh`. 

In case you want to change the size of your K-map while using the `karnaugh` function, you can pass `canvas-args: (length: 2cm)`. One cell will now be 2cm. All arguments you could normally pass to a cetz canvas, you can also pass to `canvas-args`.

Performance note: In case you ever want to draw extremely large K-maps, set `use-cetz-naming: false`. This will break the naming of cells inside of the canvas described earlier, which is somehow terribly inefficient for large K-maps.
